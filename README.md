A pair (A[K], B[K]), for K from 0 to M-1, describes an edge between vertex A[K] and vertex B[K]. Your task is to check whether the given graph contains a path from vertex 1 to vertex N going through all of the vertices, one by one, in increasing order of their numbers.

Note that:

The road fixing machine can patch over three consecutive segments at once with asphalt and repair all the potholes located within each of these segments. Good or already repaired segments remain good after patching them. Your task is to compute the minimum number of patches required to repair all the potholes in the road. Write a function: def solution (S) that, given a string S of length N, returns the minimum number of patches required to repair all the potholes. Examples:1.

ex28: You are given a list of all the transactions on a bank account during the year 2020. The account was empty at the beginning of the year (the balance was 0). //Each transaction specifies the amount and the date it was executed. If the amount is negative (less than 0) then it was a card payment, otherwise it was an Incoming transfer (amount at least 0). The date of each transaction is in YYYY-MM-DD format: for example, 2020-05-20 represents 20th May 2020. Additionally, there is a fee for having a card (omitted in the given transaction list), which is 5 per month. This fee is deducted from the account balance at the end of each month unless there were at least three payments made by card for a total cost of at least 100 within that month. Your task is to compute the final balance of the account at the end of the year 2020. Write a function: class Solution (public int solution(int[] A, String[] D); } that, given an array A of N integers representing transaction amounts and an array D of N strings representing transaction dates, returns the final balance of the account at the end of the year 2020. Transaction number K (for K within the range [0..N-1]) was executed on the date represented by D[K) for amount A[K] Examples: 1. Given A = [100, 100, 100, - 10] and D =["2020-12-31", "2020-12-22", "2020-12-03", "2020-12-29"], the function should return 230.

The fee is paid every month. 1 - 1 + 0 - 105 + 1 - (5 * 12) = - 164 Note that in April, even though the total cost of card payments was 106 (more than 100), there were only two payments made by card, so the fee was still applied. A transaction of value 0 is considered a positive, incoming transfer. 4. Given and D = ['2020-01-01", "2020-02-01", "2020-02-11", "2020-02-05", "2020-02-08"), the function should return 60.

ex33: Charlemagne, the King of Frankia, is considering building some castles on the border with Servia. The border is divided into N segments. The King knows the height of the terrain in each segment of the border. The height of each segment of terrain is stored in array A, with A[P] denoting the height of the P-th segment of the border. The King has decided to build a castle on top of every hill and in the bottom of every valley. Let [P..Q] denote a group of consecutive segments from P to Q inclusive such that (0 <= P <= Q <= N - 1) Segments [P..Q] form a hill or a valley if all the following conditions are satisfied: • The terrain height of each segment from P to Q is the same ( A[P] = A[P + 1] =...=A[Q]) • P > 0 A[P - 1] < A[P] (for a hill) or A[P - 1] > A[P] (for a valley); If Q < N - 1 then A[Q + 1] < A[Q] (for a hill) or A[Q + 1] > A[Q] (for a valley); That is, a hill is higher than its surroundings and a valley is lower than its surroundings. Note that if the surroundings on either side of the hill or valley don't exist (i.e. at the edges of the area under consideration, where P = 0 or Q = N - 1 ) then the condition is considered satisfied for that side of the hill/valley.The king is wondering how many castles is he going to build.

ex34: A garden is divided into N sections numbered from 0 to N-1. It is described by an array A where A[K] denotes the number of trees in the K-th section. To make the garden look more organized, we want the number of trees in every section to be the same. As we don't want to cut any trees down, we can perform either of the following actions: planting a new tree in one of the sections; replanting an existing tree, moving it from one section to another. We want to minimize the number of actions performed. Write a function: function solution(A); that, given an array A consisting of N integers describing the garden, returns the minimum number of actions we need to perform in order to make all sections of the garden contain the same number of trees. Examples: 1. Given A = [1, 2, 2, 4] the function should return 4. We can move one tree from A[3] to A[1] and obtain A = [1, 3, 2, 3] Then we can plant two trees in A[0] and one tree in A[2] to make every section contain three trees. 2. Given A = [4, 2, 4, 6] the function should return 2. We can move two trees from A[3] to A[1] This way, every section in the garden will contain four trees. 3. Given A = [1, 1, 2, 1] the function should return 3. We can plant one tree in A[0] A[1] and A[3] so that each section in the garden contains two trees. Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions: N is an integer within the range [1.100,000); each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000); the answer is always less than or equal to 2,000,000,000.

ex35: There are N blocks, numbered from 0 to N−1, arranged in a row. A couple of frogs were sitting together on one block when they had a terrible quarrel. Now they want to jump away from one another so that the distance between them will be as large as possible. The distance between blocks numbered J and K, where J≤K, is computed as K−J+1. The frogs can only jump up, meaning that they can move from one block to another only if the two blocks are adjacent and the second block is of the same or greater height as the first. What is the longest distance that they can possibly create between each other, if they also chose to sit on the optimal starting block initially? 
Write a function: function solution (blocks); that, given an array blocks consisting of N integers denoting the heights of the blocks, returns the longest possible distance that two frogs can make between each other starting from one of the blocks.

Given blocks =[1,1], the function should return 2 . If starting from blocks[1], the first frog can jump to blocks[0] and the second frog can stay where it is. Starting from blocks[0] would result in the same distance. 3. Given blocks =[1,1], the function should return 2 .

Your task is to find a pair of strings in array S, such that there exists a position in which both of the strings have the same letter. Both the index in array S and the positions in the strings are numbered from zero. For example, given S = ["abc", "bca", "dbe"], string 0 ("abc") and string 2 ("dbe") have the same letter 'b' in position 1. On the other hand, for strings "abc" and "bca" there does not exist a position in which they have the same letter. Write a function: class Solution { public int[] solution(String[] S); } that, given a zero-indexed array S of N strings, returns an array describing a pair of strings from S which share a common letter at some index. If there is no such pair, the function should return an empty array. If there is more than one correct answer, the function can return any of them. The result should be represented as an array containing three integers. The first two integers are the indexes in S of the strings belonging to the pair. The third integer is the position of the common letter. For S = ["abc", "bca", "dbe"], as above, the result array should be represented as: [0, 2, 11. Another correct answer is [2, 0, 1], as the order of indexes of strings does not matter.
